            <p class="summary">
              Like any language, Scala has pros and cons, making it a great choice for jobs at which it really excels. In this article, we discuss jobs for which Scala is particularly suited and some alternatives for jobs where Scala may be the wrong tool. We also take a look at the idea of language purity and how being able to use the right tool for the job, rather than force Scala to do every job, makes for a more versatile developer.

            <p class="summary">
              One of the hardest but most fundamental jobs of a developer is to approach a large, complex problem and break it down into smaller, self-contained, simpler components. Akka helps you do this by letting you define nicely-encapsulated, independent actors, allowing you to describe your functionality with a messaging API and store some internal state as needed.
            </p>
          
            <p class="summary">
              In part one of a series on this project, today we&#39;ll take a look at the top-level architectural design of a multiplayer games backend serving several different games on the web.

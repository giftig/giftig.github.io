          <p class="summary">
            Data modelling and JSON serialisation are very common concerns for any backend application, and Scala provides the ability to transform any JSON data into a strongly-typed set of models suitable for use within your application. This article covers some of the principles of modelling your data effectively and managing your serialisation logic, even in cases where the JSON data is poorly designed or difficult to work with.

    <p>Today I&#39;ll be sharing the high-level architecture and design features of a project I wrote back in 2018 using
Akka actors. This is a reasonably complex project, and does a decent job of illustrating several points of
how to build generic, reusable actors to perform useful functions.</p>
<p>This article is the first of a series where we&#39;ll look in more depth at individual components of this design.
In this article, we&#39;ll look at the high-level project design, how we break down a complex problem into
simple, reusable components, and how to structure and build the solution in Akka at a high level.</p>

<h1 id="a-multiplayer-games-backend">A multiplayer games backend</h1>
<p>Firstly, the project goal. A few years ago, a major passion project involved creating multiplayer games
which could be played on my website. I had a few of these of varying complexity, from a slightly wacky
&quot;enhanced&quot; version of snakes and ladders, to a Yahtzee-inspired &quot;rainbow dice&quot; game, to a complicated card
game, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/215/tichu">Tichu</a>. The latest iteration of these games, around 2016-2018, involved some javascript
frontend work hosted on my website, and a backend written in Scala with Akka actors. We&#39;ll be looking at the
backend.</p>
<p>The games have a fair bit of variety, but they were all online multiplayer, turn-based board or card games,
so they all worked with a fairly similar model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a lobby to let players join</li>
<li>Start the game with players currently participating in the lobby</li>
<li>Decide turn order</li>
<li>Let players make moves, in turn order, and update the game state according to the results of each move</li>
<li>Publish player moves to all players (sometimes with private details hidden)</li>
<li>Determine when the game was over and who won</li>
<li>End the game, and reward the winner(s) somehow</li>
</ol>
<p>The details of the latter steps in particular vary greatly from game to game, but clearly there&#39;s a lot of
common ground here even between very different games.</p>
<p>The basic design, then, involved firstly designing some actors which could generically perform common roles,
like defining a lobby and the logic around when it&#39;s ready for a game to start, who has permissions to start
the game and/or invite people, and other &quot;lobby&quot; functionality. Similarly, enforcing turn order happens with
the help of the <code>TurnController</code> which we insert in front of our game logic to &quot;guard&quot; it from out of order
actions, duplicate actions, and races. We also need a feed of actions which are happening, both to inform
users and to allow us to adopt an event-driven approach.</p>
<p>Along with those pieces common to all games, we define specific actor relationships and state models for the
specific game, and define the logic of our game: which actions can be taken, when does the turn end, what
does our scoring and our game board look like, when is the game over?</p>
<p>Ultimately this needs to reach the user in the frontend, so we interface our internal actors with an HTTP
interface, providing some endpoints for checking game state and taking actions, and providing a websocket
feed to subscribe to real time events.</p>
<h1 id="high-level-structure">High-level structure</h1>
<p>One excellent feature of Akka is the ability to easily draw what we&#39;re building, since we&#39;re creating actors
which will talk to each other in much the same way as services might talk to each other. At a high level,
we can look at how our top-level actors communicate with each other to handle setting up and tearing down
games, and at a lower level we can zoom into child actors and see how they work as well.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s first take a look at a simplified structure of a game:</p>
<div class="diagram">
  <img
    src="/img/blog/akka-multiplayer-games-architecture-game-lobby-overview.svg"
    alt="Game-lobby architecture diagram"
  >
</div>

<p>In this diagram, each component is an actor or group of actors, and is fully encapsulated. They perform
specific, reusable functions and communicate with other actors. Let&#39;s take a look at some of the components
we need to make this work.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-daemon">The game daemon</h2>
<p>This is the top-level manager actor for one type of game, and deals with creating individual games and
holding their references, and providing an interface to manage them. This is what the user will be talking to
when creating an initial game lobby or connecting to a game by ID. It supervises all games as well,
attempting to recover or replace any lost actors.</p>
<p>When a game is created, it&#39;ll spin up a child <code>GameFramework</code> actor, which then handles everything to do with
the game.</p>
<p>Ultimately we serve an interface for multiple games, where each has a slug and a daemon actor, so that we
can direct our queries to the <code>snakes-and-ladders</code> daemon or the <code>four-in-a-row</code> daemon as appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-framework">The game framework</h2>
<p>This is the parent actor encapsulating everything needed for one instance of a game, throughout the
lifecycle. It spins up children for all of the components you see beneath it in the diagram. This is a
generic component, as every type of game needs a feed, a lobby, and an actor to deal with the game logic;
we&#39;ll swap out that last piece per game. This actor will perform all the high-level housekeeping functions
for any type of game.</p>
<p>The framework understands the lobby and game lifecycle, stores game participants, controls how the feed is
hooked up to other components during the lifecycle, and acts as the parent to every other component. This
means it&#39;ll supervise everything beneath it and handle tasks like ensuring games are torn down if left idle.</p>
<p>The framework is created when the user requests to start a new game by talking to the game daemon, ultimately
by making an HTTP POST request like <code>/game-type/create</code> and receiving back an ID to interact with the
instance. It sets up the initial components and hooks up the lobby to the feed. Once the lobby completes and
the game start is requested, it ensures the game itself is initialised and allows the game to take over
control of user interaction instead.</p>
<h2 id="the-lobby">The lobby</h2>
<p>The lobby is the initial &quot;room&quot; before the game starts, where we start collecting participants and get
ready to launch the game. It provides several few pieces of functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to join and leave</li>
<li>Limit the number of users who can be in the lobby</li>
<li>Provide invite / kick / ban functionality to authorised users</li>
<li>Respect minimum / maximum participant limits</li>
<li>Tell the feed about join / leave events, or that the lobby is complete and the game is starting</li>
<li>Send a summary of the final lobby state to the <code>GameFramework</code> parent when it completes, and kill itself</li>
</ul>
<p>The lobby lifecycle begins when the parent <code>GameFramework</code> begins, and ends when the game is set to begin;
the lobby yields a set of users who will be playing, and the game will be initialised with those users.</p>
<h2 id="the-feed">The feed</h2>
<p>The feed primarily exists as a broadcast mechanism, allowing subscribers to register when a user connects
via websocket. It also assists in adopting an event-driven approach to our game logic, so that in event of
failure, we can recover the game state by replaying the feed into the game. There are a few considerations
here:</p>
<ul>
<li>a user may join late or need to refresh and reconnect, so we need to be able to flexibly receive the
feed from the beginning, from the end, or from a particularly ID the user last saw.</li>
<li>events may need to be masked before sending out to users; e.g. when a user draws a card from the deck,
the feed should not tell everyone what card was drawn</li>
<li>as for the events themselves, they should always at least have an ID, an idea of what is public vs
private data to mask, and to aid in processing messages in the frontend, an idea of what event &quot;caused&quot;
the next one. Several events are also common across all games, for example <code>GameStarted</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means we have a few pieces of logic to make our feed really useful, as well as needing a solid <code>Event</code>
model which games can extend, or draw from a pool of common definitions.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-logic">The game logic</h2>
<p>The game component will itself be an actor, and encodes all the logic of the game. For a simple game like
Snakes and Ladders, this may be a single actor which holds all the game state and responds to a couple of
potential actions to advance the game. For a complex card game like Tichu, there may be multiple phases to
a round, player hands and scores to track, and therefore it will spin up and shut down various groups of
child actors to deal with the internals. In most cases it will place itself behind a <code>TurnController</code> to
avoid having to worry about whose turn it is, so this behaviour is provided as standard.</p>
<h2 id="the-turn-controller">The turn controller</h2>
<p>This component encapsulates the common logic of guarding the game from out-of-order actions and deciding
whose turn it is, and is used by any turn-based game. It has the following behaviours:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will intercept all actions and pass them through if and only if the action was taken by the user who
currently has a turn</li>
<li>it will deal with race conditions by locking itself once an action is passed on, and only unlocking
itself once the game logic confirms the next action to take: advance the turn, jump to a new turn, or
unlock and continue the same turn. While locked, no actions will be permitted at all, so we require
an acknowledgement before continuing.</li>
<li>it is given a set of participants and will decide the initial turn order</li>
<li>it can be told when the turn should be advanced, and if the game requires it, jump to a specific user</li>
<li>players can be marked as out of the game to remove them from the current turn order</li>
</ul>
<p>This effectively makes the <code>TurnController</code> a proxy which both decides and enforces turn order, and can be
configured by the game to customise its behaviour when needed. The actor is inserted between the interface
and the game and this prevents the game having to worry about turn order or races.</p>
<h1 id="sharding">Sharding</h1>
<p>Since these multiplayer games have finite player limits, the service can be scaled up with only very limited
exposure to the drawbacks of distributed computing. We can pick a sharding strategy which distributes
our individual <code>GameFramework</code> actor groups across our nodes, meaning that everything internal to the game
will always take place on a single node, and we don&#39;t risk dropping regular messages during the course of
the game.</p>
<p>This means that only the top level <code>GameDaemon</code> will need to send messages between nodes of the application,
so message delivery failures will happen early: only a game creation or an attempt to connect to a feed can
fail, and both can be retried safely. <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster.html">Akka cluster</a> provides the functionality we need to
send messages to actors on different nodes, but it does unavoidably have weaker message delivery guarantees
than those passed between two different actors in the same JVM.</p>
<h1 id="http-interface">HTTP interface</h1>
<p>The heavily-structured nature of the actor hierarchy corresponds nicely to a RESTful API with structured
URLs. Without going into too much detail, a progressive structure like
<code>game/snakes-and-ladders/12345/action/roll/</code> descends the logical actor hierarchy to deliver actions to a
specific game. This makes the route structure fairly transparently reflect the actor system structure and
aids in understanding and debugging. Since players also need realtime updates on what&#39;s going on in the game,
users subscribe to a websocket feed like <code>game/snakes-and-ladders/12345/feed</code> to receive continuous updates
on what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p>This interface is served via akka http, and after performing authentication and parsing and validating any
JSON actions delivered, communicates with the underlying actor system to deliver the message.</p>
<h1 id="take-aways">Take aways</h1>
<p>A lot of what I&#39;ve discussed here is a highly-specific use case for akka actors, but hopefully some of the
designs here can be used as inspiration for other challenging projects. Here are some takeaways for designing
your own actor systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building an actor system makes it easy to draw and reason about the inner workings of the application, and
in turn helps you break down a large, complex problem into a series of smaller building blocks</li>
<li>You can stay DRY in an actor system by encapsulating shared functionality into an actor or hierarchy of
actors which provide a key service to others</li>
<li>High-level architectural design is crucial to breaking down a difficult problem</li>
<li>Remember that sending messages across network boundaries with Akka Cluster comes with performance and
reliability costs, so effectively sharding an application to minimise those boundaries is worthwhile</li>
</ul>
<p>In future articles, I&#39;ll dive into several individual components in more depth to see exactly how we
build and test actors with the behaviours described here.</p>

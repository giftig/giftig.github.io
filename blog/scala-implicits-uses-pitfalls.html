<h1 id="types-of-implicits">Types of implicits</h1>
<p>There are a few types of implicits in Scala, and they all work at compile time, by providing the compiler
with a means of resolving what would otherwise be a type error or missing argument.</p>
<h2 id="implicit-arguments">Implicit arguments</h2>
<p>The most straightforward implicits to understand are implicit argument lists in a function or class. Consider
the following, a very common use case for implicits:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">class FishRepository(host: String)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext) {
  def findOne(id: String): Future[Fish] = ???
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here we define a repository which deals with fetching records about scaly sea creatures from a database.
Since our repository will work with concurrency using <code>Future</code>s, it&#39;s going to need to know which
<code>ExecutionContext</code> to use. We want that to be configurable further up the stack, since we might need to
tweak our execution contexts based on load in different parts of the application, and most likely want
database IO to run on a dedicated future pool.</p>
<p>To save us the effort of passing in an explicit <code>ExecutionContext</code> everywhere it may be needed throughout
the stack, we simply declare it an implicit argument and allow it to be resolved automatically.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ExecutionContext.global

val fisher = new FishRepository(&quot;localhost&quot;)  // implicit ec is filled in for us
</code></pre>
<p>To fill in these implicit arguments, the compiler will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notice that you&#39;ve not provided the implicit argument list</li>
<li>Look for definitions in scope marked <code>implicit</code> with type <code>ExecutionContext</code></li>
<li>Having found <strong>exactly one</strong>, provide it to the function</li>
<li>Repeat from (2) for any other arguments in this set of brackets</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s important to note that point (3) here means you have to be careful with scoping your implicits, and with
which types are declared as implicit arguments. If an implicit can be fulfilled in multiple ways it will
simply fail, and you&#39;ll have to either change the scope of your implicits or provide the arguments
explicitly instead. In general they should be <em>very specific</em> types, to avoid confusion or ambiguity about
what is expected.</p>
<p>If you defined an implicit <code>String</code> argument, for example, it could mean anything – a name, a hoststring, a
password, a type of root vegetable. An implicit <code>Int</code> might be a buffer size, a rate limit, a concurrency
limit, or all of the above. To avoid this, use a specific type, creating one if needbe – e.g.
<code>case class Parallelism(val value: Int)</code> is one I&#39;ve used in the past to encapsulate the parallelism setting
desired in akka stream components.</p>
<h2 id="implicit-classes">Implicit classes</h2>
<p>Implicit classes are typically used in Scala to provide type class functionality. This is a means of
achieving &quot;ad hoc polymorphism&quot; – adding a capability to a type on the fly, and without needing to modify
or have any control over the type in question.</p>
<p>An excellent example of type classes in Scala, and one which I <a href="modelling-json-scala.html">touched upon last week</a>,
is adding JSON serialisation functionality to your models. Here&#39;s a simplified example which acts as CSV
encoding behaviour, currently for a single case class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">case class Fish(species: String, age: Int, endangered: Boolean)

implicit class FishEncoder(fish: Fish) {
  def toCsv: String = Seq(fish.species, fish.age, fish.endangered).mkString(&quot;,&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to treat <code>toCsv</code> as a method of <code>Fish</code>, even though it&#39;s not defined on the class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">&gt; Fish(&quot;Salmon&quot;, 12, false).toCsv
res1: String = &quot;Salmon,12,false&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Defining a type class to a single specific type like this isn&#39;t very helpful in the case of a JSON or CSV
encoder, so we&#39;ll <a href="#generic-implicits">revisit this example</a> shortly to make it more generic.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what the compiler is doing in this case:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look for a method called <code>toCsv</code> defined on <code>Fish</code> or one of its parents</li>
<li>Fail to find that, so now look for in-scope implicit classes for <code>Fish</code> which might provide one</li>
<li>Find <code>FishEncoder</code>, instantiate it with our <code>Fish</code>, and call <code>toCsv</code> on this instance instead</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="implicit-conversions">Implicit conversions</h2>
<p>Firstly, note that implicit conversions are <strong>no longer recommended for use</strong>, and you should use implicit
classes to achieve the same thing instead. In fact, standard library tooling like the implicit
conversion-based <code>scala.concurrent.JavaConversions</code> was deprecated in favour of the implicit class-based
<code>scala.concurrent.JavaConverters</code> several versions ago, and since removed entirely in 2.13.</p>
<p>Implicit conversions convert one type to another using an implicit function. These are the &quot;most magical&quot;
types of implicits in that the process is entirely implicit – unlike implicit classes, where you call a
method, hinting that there&#39;s an implicit class involved if it&#39;s not defined on the class itself. With
implicit conversions, you can simply use the source type as if it were the target type.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">import scala.language.implicitConversions

case class Fish(species: String, age: Int, endangered: Boolean)
case class FishSummary(fishCount: Int, hasEndangered: Boolean)

implicit def fishToSummary(fish: Seq[Fish]): FishSummary = {
  FishSummary(fish.length, fish.exists { _.endangered })
}
</code></pre>
<p>With the implicit conversion defined and in scope, we can simply treat a <code>Seq[Fish]</code> as if it were a
<code>FishSummary</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">&gt; val summary: FishSummary = Seq(Fish(&quot;Salmon&quot;, 12, false), Fish(&quot;Atlantic Halibut&quot;, 9, true))
summary: FishSummary = FishSummary(2, true)

// --- or, pass it into a function which expects a FishSummary, like:
def printSummary(summary: FishSummary): Unit = print(summary)

&gt; printSummary(Seq(Fish(&quot;Salmon&quot;, 12, false), Fish(&quot;Atlantic Halibut&quot;, 9, true)))
FishSummary(2,true)
</code></pre>
<p>This time, the compiler resolves the implicit as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check that the argument is the correct type, i.e. <code>Seq[Fish]</code> conforms to type <code>FishSummary</code></li>
<li>Seeing that it doesn&#39;t, look for an in-scope implicit conversion which takes a <code>Seq[Fish]</code> and
produces <code>FishSummary</code></li>
<li>Call the implicit conversion to produce the type which the compiler expected, <code>FishSummary</code></li>
</ol>
<p>But, to reiterate: implicit conversions are <strong>no longer recommended</strong> since they&#39;re too prone to be
confusing: since version 2.10, the compiler will produce a warning if you define them. You can acknowledge
this and switch off the warning by importing <code>scala.language.implicitConversions</code> as shown above. In
extremely narrow use cases a locally-scoped implicit conversion may produce a small readability benefit, so
this will allow you to use them without warnings if you really need one.</p>
<p>To perform the same operation shown above using an implicit class, you could use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">implicit class RichFishSeq(fish: Seq[Fish]) {
  def toSummary: FishSummary = FishSummary(fish.length, fish.exists { _.endangered })
}

val summary: FishSummary = {
  Seq(Fish(&quot;Salmon&quot;, 12, false), Fish(&quot;Atlantic Halibut&quot;, 9, true)).toSummary
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is, regardless, quite a contrived example, and likely too specific to be a good use case for
an implicit at all. A simple utility function to create the summary is likely to be much easier to
understand in this case. Exercise restraint in deciding when to use an implicit.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="organising-implicits">Organising implicits</h1>
<p>For implicits to work, they have to be in scope when they&#39;re used. Given that the purpose of implicits is to
make your code concise and readable and avoid mixing layers of logic, you&#39;ll likely want to package them
separately and reusably.</p>
<p>Typically, implicits are packaged like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">trait FishImplicits {
  implicit class RichFishSeq(fish: Seq[Fish]) {
    def toSummary: FishSummary = ???
  }

  // More fish-related puns / converters
}

object FishImplicits extends FishImplicits
</code></pre>
<p>This is a standard pattern you&#39;ll see in many libraries, as it allows you to use either
<code>import FishImplicits._</code> or <code>extends FishImplicits</code> to bring your implicits into scope. This gives you some
flexibility to compose traits to collect together implicits, or limit their scope by importing. This, in
turn, allows you to control the exact scope of your implicits to minimise confusion.</p>
<p>Note also that we&#39;ve also used <code>Implicits</code> in the name, making it very clear that we&#39;re bringing in some
implicits. The name may be slightly more specific where appropriate, e.g. Spray JSON implicits are defined in
<code>XXXJsonProtocol</code> traits, and the standard library scala-to-java collection converters are called
<code>AsScalaConverters</code>. In all cases we aim for clarity that implicits are involved and that we&#39;re effectively
bringing in a new DSL. This gives us a heads up of where to look if we&#39;re experiencing unexpected behaviour
or wondering about unexpected syntax, as unannounced implicits can cause real pain.</p>
<p>Finally, a specific call-out: for all of the reasons above, do not be tempted to place implicits in the
package object. Package objects are generally best avoided entirely, as they can make scoping confusing
regardless, but that&#39;s further compounded when you&#39;re using implicits. Implicits should always involve a
clear import as a heads up that they&#39;re present.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="generic-implicits">Generic implicits</h1>
<p>Implicit classes become even more powerful when they&#39;re combined with generic types, as I hinted at earlier
when describing how a typical JSON (or CSV) library might work. A full discussion of this is best left for
another day, but to complete our earlier thought, let&#39;s have a quick look at how a typical JSON library
works, by thinking about how our <code>toCsv</code> API might be completed for generic types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">// We need to provide a CsvEncoding subclass for each type we want to encode to CSV
trait CsvEncoding[T] {
  def encode(t: T): String
}

// The core of the CSV encoder implicits; this defines any type as encodable to CSV
// if an implicit CsvEncoding is available, using the toCsv method
trait CsvImplicits {
  implicit class CsvEncodable[T : CsvEncoding](t: T) {
    def toCsv: String = implicitly[CsvEncoding[T]].encode(t)
  }
}

// Our type-specific encodings
trait FishCsvEncodings {
  implicit object FishCsvEncoding extends CsvEncoding[Fish] {
    override def encode(fish: Fish): String = {
      Seq(fish.species, fish.age, fish.endangered).mkString(&quot;,&quot;)
    }
  }
}

// Finally, just bring both the CSV implicits and our fish CSV encodings into scope
object App extends CsvImplicits with FishCsvEncodings {
  val fishy: String = Fish(&quot;trout&quot;, 11, false).toCsv
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works by defining a <code>CsvEncodable</code> type which will work for any type which has an implicit <code>CsvEncoding</code>
available. The <code>.toCsv</code> behaviour comes from <code>CsvEncodable</code>, and it falls back on the definition you&#39;ve
provided via a <code>CsvEncoding</code> instance. Bring both the implicit class and your set of implicit encoders into
scope, and the API works as expected.</p>
<p>Two things to clear up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, <code>[T : CsvEncoding]</code> is a syntactic sugar which requires a <code>CsvEncoding[T]</code> to be in scope</li>
<li>Secondly, <code>implicitly[T]</code> is a function which takes an implicit <code>T</code> and simply returns it; it&#39;s used to
refer to the implicit instance without having a name for it</li>
</ul>
<p>With that sugar removed, this is defined as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">implicit class CsvEncodable[T](t: T)(implicit ev: CsvEncoding[T]) {
  def toCsv: String = ev.encode(t)
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are a few ways which this could all be improved, of course, as our CSV &quot;encoder&quot; is very naive. We may
also consider an additional DSL to add <code>toCsvString</code> to types to determine how individual fields should be
converted to strings before inserting into the CSV, rather than assuming calling <code>.toString</code> on them produces
the desired result. I leave it to the reader to think about other improvements we could make here.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="a-horror-story">A horror story</h1>
<p>Since I&#39;ve touched a few times on some potential pitfalls of using implicits poorly, with too-weak types,
poor scoping, or simply overzealousness, I&#39;d like to share a horror story from a codebase I had to work with
several years ago.</p>
<p>The codebase in question was a large monolithic application which generally had a lot of problems, including
very weak types used, frequent use of <code>Map[String, Any]</code> and similar instead of case classes, large numbers
of fields combined in difficult-to-follow ways, a 55-minute build time, very difficult to parse logs, poor
test coverage, and a structure which made unit testing difficult.</p>
<p>All of this contributed to slow development, but one particular implicit incident is engraved in my memory.</p>
<p>I first stumbled into this by attempting to call a method like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">def store(id: ObjectId, title: String, encoding: String, date: Instant): Future[Unit]
</code></pre>
<p>like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">repository.store(title, id, encoding, Instant.now())
</code></pre>
<p>If you&#39;re keen-eyed, you&#39;ll see that I&#39;ve transposed the first two arguments. This is often a drawback of
having too-weak types, and if both were <code>String</code>s I&#39;d likely only find this out during a test run, or in this
application, by carefully scrutinising logs or database records to find that my ID was wrong. But with one
argument having type <code>ObjectId</code> this simply won&#39;t compile, and I&#39;ll immediately see the problem. Right?
Wrong.</p>
<p>Enter an implicit conversion, defined in the package object, in a package with 100+ classes, hidden from
sight:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">implicit def any2ObjectId(a: Any): ObjectId = a match {
  case id: ObjectId =&gt; id
  case str: String =&gt; ObjectId(str)
  case _ =&gt; throw new Exception(&quot;Bad object ID&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unhelpfully, this broad implicit was trying to correct my compile error by forcing the type to <code>ObjectId</code> if
I provided a <code>String</code>, or anything else for that matter. Combined with other issues in the codebase, the
resulting camouflaged error took a staggering two weeks to identify.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re keen-eyed again, you may also notice that the first branch of the <code>match</code> here is unreachable:
the compiler will not reach for the implicit conversion if it already has an <code>ObjectId</code>, so this could not be
called with one. With that in mind, I&#39;d like to also give an honourable mention to another implicit I found
alongside it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">implicit def any2Any(a: Any): Any = a match {
  case id: ObjectId =&gt; id
  case str: String =&gt; ObjectId(str)
  case _ =&gt; throw new Exception(&quot;Bad object ID&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>...which, thankfully, does nothing at all.</p>
<p>We collectively resolved to eliminate these implicits, which was a long process, as deleting some of them
spawned several hundred compile errors all across a monolith a dozen developers were actively working on.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="tldr">tl;dr</h1>
<p>An executive summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use implicits to separate high-level and low-level logic in a concise way, or to pass configuration
arguments down the stack without repeating yourself</li>
<li>Keep your types strong, your use of implicits very transparent, and only use implicits if they add
readability and do not cause confusion. Think carefully whether implicits are an improvement.</li>
<li>Do not use implicit conversions; use implicit classes instead.</li>
</ul>
